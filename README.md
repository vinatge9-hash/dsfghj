# Brew Haven Website

This repository contains static HTML pages for a modern, responsive coffee shop website named Brew Haven. The site uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes a dark, three-column footer with inline SVG icons, a parallax-like hero, sections for menu, shop, blog, and contact information. All images are placeholders following the required format.

Files:
- index.html: Homepage with hero, featured items, testimonials, gallery, visit us, and newsletter.
- about.html: Founding story, mission, values.
- menu.html: Full categorized menu with items and prices.
- shop.html: E-commerce storefront with sample products.
- contact.html: Contact form and location details with embedded map.
- blog.html: Blog overview with sample posts.

Notes:
- The current year in footer is 2025 (as per date in context).
- Location defaults to Hyderabad, Telangana, India for placeholders.
- All icons are inline SVGs styled with Tailwind classes.
- Font placeholders are loaded at the top of HTML files; fonts are applied via inline font-family styles to sections.
- Mock APIs: For development, consider routing /api/mock/shop-items and /api/mock/blog-posts in a local dev environment if you wire a dynamic layer later.
